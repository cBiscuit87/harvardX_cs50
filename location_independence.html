    <h1>Location Independence</h1>
    <p>Becoming location independent has been a dream of mine for a long time.  Only recently with kids growing fast, have I come to really appreciate how valuable our time is and is pushing me to strive harder for location indepenence. In this way, I can allow myself to work from a broader set of locations and spend more time with the ones I love.</p>
