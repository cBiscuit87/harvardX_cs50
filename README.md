Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## About This Homepage

The motivation for this site designer's interest in taking this course is his current early-mid-life-crisis.  Feeling a little disenfranchised working for the industrial military complex, this designer would like to find a change of pace and actually contribute to humanity.  This webpage documents the current plan to change career paths from a Corporate Mechanical Engineer to a Location Independent Humanity Advocate.

1. The first step in this journey is some foundational learning in programming.  Programming is certainly not a new subject, but with a Mechanical Engineering background programming was never very formal and more of a hack-it-till-you-make-it.  The goal during phase 1 is to learn the basic fundamentals of programming in order to improve my overall marketability.

2. Once a good strong foundation in Computer Science is established, the next step is to use that foundation to build some side-hustle income and establish a portfolio and network to eventually become location independent.

3. Once the network and portfolio are built out, it's time to find some remote gigs, sell the house, buy an RV and take the family across North America, contribute to society, advance humanity, and enjoy the time I have with my girls in this beautiful world we live in.
